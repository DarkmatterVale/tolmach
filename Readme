This program is a BeOS port of KDictionary translation program for Linux by Ivan V. Murasko. It follows the main concept of original linux program but mainly is a real BeOS program. All user interface was written in native BeOS API. The dictionary handling code was also re-factored and slightly adapted for needs of new user interface. Look into kdictionary sources and complemental materials for details on dictionaries, format and etc.

There is no documentation. All you need to know is in sources. The user interface of program is simple and dosn't require any explains.
